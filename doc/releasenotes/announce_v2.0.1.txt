Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 2.0.1, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release improves fixes some issues with CUBIT/Trelis
compatibility in example journal files.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/packages/short/pylith

Detailed installation instructions for the binary packages are in the
User Manual with detailed building instructions for a few platforms in
the INSTALL file bundled with the PyLith Installer utility.


======================================================================
MIGRATING FROM VERSION 1.9 TO 2.0
======================================================================

Changes to various C++ objects permitted simplifying the specification
of a number of components. The map below indicates the name changes.

  CellFilterAvgMesh -> CellFilterAvg
  DataWriterVTKMesh -> DataWriterVTK
  DataWriterVTKSubMesh -> DataWriterVTK
  DataWriterVTKSubSubMesh -> DataWriterVTK
  DataWriterHDF5Mesh -> DataWriterHDF5
  DataWriterHDF5SubMesh -> DataWriterHDF5
  DataWriterHDF5SubSubMesh -> DataWriterHDF5
  DataWriterHDF5ExtMesh -> DataWriterHDF5Ext
  DataWriterHDF5ExtSubMesh -> DataWriterHDF5Ext
  DataWriterHDF5ExtSubSubMesh -> DataWriterHDF5Ext

  Running the script:

    bash $PYLITH_DIR/doc/developer/update_1.9to2.0.sh

  will update all .cfg files in the current directory and all
  subdirectories with the new names (you will need to replace
  $PYLITH_DIR with the directory containing the PyLith source code).


PyLith allows use of the Chaco and ParMetis/Metis partitioners. The
name of the ParMetis/Metis partitioner was changed from "parmetis" to
"metis".

  [pylithapp.mesh_generator]
  distributor.partitioner = metis

Buried edges of faults are handled differently in v2.0. A separate
nodeset/pset should be created and contain the vertices on the buried
edges of the fault. See the Section 6.4.2 of the PyLith manual for
more information.

RELEASE NOTES - PyLith v2.0.1
======================================================================

* Added example (examples/2d/gravity) for viscoelastic deformation in
  2-D with gravitational body forces and small strain formulation.

* Bug fixes

  - Improved example journal files for CUBIT/Trelis to improve
    compability. All journal files should work with CUBIT 14.1 and
    Trelis 15.0.

  - Created examples of IDless journal files in examples/2d/greensfns.
    These files should work with all recent versions of CUBIT and
    Trelis.

  - Switched journal APREPRO lines to have leading '$' instead of '#'
    to differentiate from comments.
