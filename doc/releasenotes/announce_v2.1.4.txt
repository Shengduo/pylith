Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 2.1.4, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release provides a few new minor features and bugfixes.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith

Detailed installation instructions for the binary packages are in the
User Manual with detailed building instructions for a few platforms in
the INSTALL file bundled with the PyLith Installer utility. We also
offer a Docker image
(https://wiki.geodynamics.org/software:pylith:docker) for running
PyLith within a portable, virtual Linux environment.
