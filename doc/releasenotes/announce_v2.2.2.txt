Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 2.2.2, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release provides a small number of bugfixes.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith

Detailed installation instructions for the binary packages are in the
User Manual with detailed building instructions for a few platforms in
the INSTALL file bundled with the PyLith Installer utility. 

======================================================================
MIGRATING FROM VERSION 2.1 TO 2.2
======================================================================

No changes are needed to parameter or other input files. The default
format for pylithinfo output is now JSON.

RELEASE NOTES
======================================================================

* Bug fixes

    - Fix several typos in the manual.

    - Fix order of deallocation of data members in ElasticMaterial to
      prevent a segmentation fault, thereby allowing error messages to
      be shown when throwing an exception.

    - Fix tests for MPI and PETSc version info for more use cases.

    - Ensure all Python scripts are executable and use nemesis is used
      instead of python for correct paths to modules on Darwin.

* Added ability to write residual to an HDF5 file during solves. This
  is intended for debugging and is enabled at runtime using
  --journal.debug.formulation=1. The residual will be written to
  residual.h5. To generate the associated .xdmf file run
  "pylith_genxdmd -f residual.h5".

* Updated to PETSc 3.10.2
