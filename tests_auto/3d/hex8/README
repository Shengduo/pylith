Mesh is hex8 cells with nominal 5 km discretization size.

AXIALDISP: See axialdisp_soln.py
  Axial extension
  No fault
  Dirichlet BC

SHEARDISP: See sheardisp_soln.py
  Shear
  No fault
  Dirichlet BC

SHEARDISPNOSLIP:
  Same as SHEARDISP
  Embedded fault w/zero slip

SHEARDISPNOSLIPREFINE:
  Same as SHEARDISPNOSLIP
  Uniform refinement

  NOTE: The solution test currently fails in v2.0.0 because in the
  refined mesh we don't connect the vertices across the ends of the
  fault in the halo around the fault.

SLIPONEFAULT: See sliponefault_soln.py
  One through-going fault with uniform slip

SLIPTWOFAULTS: See sliptwofaults_soln.py
  Two through-going faults with uniform slip
