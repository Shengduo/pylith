Greetings,

I am pleased to announce the release of PyLith 2.2.0, a finite-element
code designed to solve dynamic elastic problems and quasi-static
viscoelastic problems in tectonic deformation.

This release provides a few new minor features and bugfixes.

You can download the source code and binaries from

    http://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith

Detailed installation instructions for the binary packages are in the
User Manual with detailed building instructions for a few platforms in
the INSTALL file bundled with the PyLith Installer utility. We also
offer a Docker image
(https://wiki.geodynamics.org/software:pylith:docker) for running
PyLith within a portable, virtual Linux environment.

MIGRATING FROM VERSION 2.1 TO 2.2
======================================================================

No changes are needed to parameter or other input files. The default
format for pylithinfo output is now JSON.

RELEASE NOTES
======================================================================

* Added a browser-based parameter viewer for interactive viewing of
  all PyLith parameters and version information. See Section 4.10
  PyLith Parameter Viewer of the PyLith user manual.

* Adjusted packaging of the binary distributions so that they can be
  used to extend PyLith and/or integrate other code with
  PyLith.

* Converted the user manual from Lyx to LaTeX and added syntax
  highlighting of parameter and spatial database files. Fixed several
  typos.

* Fixed bug that sometimes resulted in an inconsistent fault
  orientation when running in parallel. The bug appears to have been
  introduced in v2.0.

* Fixed two bugs in output of solution at points that sometimes
  happened in parallel simulations. The errors include:

    - The order of the station names does not match the order of the
      points. The point data is written in parallel by process order,
      so the points for process 0 are written first, then those for
      process 1, etc. This often results in reordering of the
      points. The station names were written in the original order.
    
    - The output values for some points are incorrect. The wrong cells
      were being used in the interpolation.

* Updated PETSc to v3.7.5.

See CHANGES in the top-level source directory for a list of changes
for each prior release.
